## Linear Regression to Predict MPG

•	Which variables/coefficients provided a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset?
The one that provide a non-random amount of variance  will be the spoiler_angle, vehicle weight, and the AWD. The variables that most amount of random variances are ground_clearence and vehicle_lenght.
•	Is the slope of the linear model considered to be zero? Why or why not?

The slope will not be zero because of the significate level is 0.05 that make the slop not be zero.

•	Does this linear model predict mpg of MechaCar prototypes effectively? Why or why not?
The indicator that will help us with this is the R-squared which in these exercises is 0.7149. meaning of this is that this will give you the correct outcome 71 times.  In my opinion this is consider effective, but if it could be more higher the outcome would be more effective because this is only giving you 71 time the correct outcome what about the other 29 percent out of 100.
 ## Summary Statistics on Suspension Coils,
 and write a short summary using screenshots from your total_summary and lot_summary dataframes, and address the following question:
•	The design specifications for the MechaCar suspension coils dictate that the variance of the suspension coils must not exceed 100 pounds per square inch. Does the current manufacturing data meet this design specification for all manufacturing lots in total and each lot individually? Why or why not?
Lot 3 over exceed the manufacturers specifications because the variances in at 62.29356

 

 ## T-Tests on Suspension Coils

then briefly summarize your interpretation and findings for the t-test results. Include screenshots of the t-test to support your summary.


 
My last t test came out with deference results as for my first two.




## Study Design: MechaCar vs Competition

•	What metric or metrics are you going to test?
The metric that I would be testing will be the city and the highway fuel efficiency.

•	What is the null hypothesis or alternative hypothesis?
The Null hypothesis is that the vehicles of the same model use the same amount of fuel.
•	What statistical test would you use to test the hypothesis? And why?
The test that I would use would be ANOVA test that is usually use to analyze the difference between the means of more than two groups. Like that is can see the differences of the fuel efficiency.

•	What data is needed to run the statistical test?	

The data that I would need is the data to 100 vehicles to make sure that the vehicles data has a higher chance to be correct. I would also need the fuel efficiency data as well.
